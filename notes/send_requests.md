The `send_requests.sh` script you provided is mostly complete, but there are a few areas where improvements or clarifications can be made. Below, I’ll explain the script, point out potential issues, and suggest enhancements.

---

### Explanation of the Script

The script is designed to interact with an API endpoint (`INVOKE_URL`) to perform the following actions:
1. **Add movies**: Sends `PUT` requests to add movies for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003.
2. **Get movies by year**: Sends `GET` requests to retrieve movies for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003.
3. **Delete a movie**: Sends a `DELETE` request to remove the movie for the year 2002.
4. **Get all movies**: Sends a `GET` request to retrieve all movies.

### Code Breakdown

#### 1. **Add Movies**
```bash
for i in $(seq 2001 2003); do
    json="$(jq -n --arg year "$i" --arg title "MovieTitle$i" '{year: $year, title: $title}')"
    curl \
        -X PUT \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d "$json" \
        "$INVOKE_URL/topmovies";
    echo
done
```
- **Purpose**: Adds movies for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003.
- **How it works**:
  - Uses `jq` to create a JSON payload with `year` and `title`.
  - Sends a `PUT` request to the API endpoint (`$INVOKE_URL/topmovies`) with the JSON payload.
- **Potential Issues**:
  - If the API expects a different payload structure, this might fail.
  - If `jq` is not installed, the script will fail.

#### 2. **Get Movies by Year**
```bash
for i in $(seq 2001 2003); do
    curl "$INVOKE_URL/topmovies/$i"
    echo
done
```
- **Purpose**: Retrieves movies for the years 2001, 2002, and 2003.
- **How it works**:
  - Sends a `GET` request to the API endpoint (`$INVOKE_URL/topmovies/$i`) for each year.
- **Potential Issues**:
  - If the API does not support querying by year, this will fail.

---

#### 3. **Delete a Movie**
```bash
curl -X DELETE "$INVOKE_URL/topmovies/2002"
echo
```
- **Purpose**: Deletes the movie for the year 2002.
- **How it works**:
  - Sends a `DELETE` request to the API endpoint (`$INVOKE_URL/topmovies/2002`).
- **Potential Issues**:
  - If the API does not support deleting by year, this will fail.

---

#### 4. **Get All Movies**
```bash
curl "$INVOKE_URL/topmovies"
```
- **Purpose**: Retrieves all movies.
- **How it works**:
  - Sends a `GET` request to the API endpoint (`$INVOKE_URL/topmovies`).
- **Potential Issues**:
  - If the API does not support retrieving all movies, this will fail.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Add error handling to check if the `curl` commands succeed. For example:
     ```bash
     if ! curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$json" "$INVOKE_URL/topmovies"; then
         echo "Failed to add movie for year $i"
     fi
     ```

2. **Check for `jq`**:
   - Ensure `jq` is installed before running the script. Add a check at the beginning:
     ```bash
     if ! command -v jq &> /dev/null; then
         echo "jq is not installed. Please install jq and try again."
         exit 1
     fi
     ```

3. **Validate API Responses**:
   - Check the HTTP status code of the API responses to ensure the requests were successful. For example:
     ```bash
     response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$json" "$INVOKE_URL/topmovies")
     if [ "$response" -ne 200 ]; then
         echo "Failed to add movie for year $i (HTTP $response)"
     fi
     ```

4. **Make the Script More Flexible**:
   - Allow the `INVOKE_URL` to be passed as a command-line argument or environment variable:
     ```bash
     INVOKE_URL=${1:-https://xxxxxxx.amazonaws.com}
     ```

5. **Add Logging**:
   - Add timestamps or more descriptive logs to make debugging easier:
     ```bash
     echo "$(date) > add movies"
     ```

### Updated Script

Here’s an improved version of your script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

INVOKE_URL=${1:-https://xxxxxxx.amazonaws.com}

# Check if jq is installed
if ! command -v jq &> /dev/null; then
    echo "jq is not installed. Please install jq and try again."
    exit 1
fi

# Add movies
echo "$(date) > add movies"
for i in $(seq 2001 2003); do
    json="$(jq -n --arg year "$i" --arg title "MovieTitle$i" '{year: $year, title: $title}')"
    response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$json" "$INVOKE_URL/topmovies")
    if [ "$response" -ne 200 ]; then
        echo "Failed to add movie for year $i (HTTP $response)"
    else
        echo "Added movie for year $i"
    fi
done

# Get movies by year
echo "$(date) > get movies by year"
for i in $(seq 2001 2003); do
    curl "$INVOKE_URL/topmovies/$i"
    echo
done

# Delete movie
echo "$(date) > delete movie from 2002"
response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -X DELETE "$INVOKE_URL/topmovies/2002")
if [ "$response" -ne 200 ]; then
    echo "Failed to delete movie for year 2002 (HTTP $response)"
else
    echo "Deleted movie for year 2002"
fi

# Get movies
echo "$(date) > get movies"
curl "$INVOKE_URL/topmovies"
```

### Key Improvements
- Added error handling for `curl` commands.
- Checked for `jq` installation.
- Made the script more flexible by allowing the `INVOKE_URL` to be passed as an argument.
- Added logging with timestamps.
